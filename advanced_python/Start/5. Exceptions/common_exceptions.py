# IndexError occurs when you try to access an index that is out of range
int_list = [0,3,6,1,8,7,3,5]


# KeyError is similar - it is raised when a key is not found in a Dictionary
my_dict = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}


# FileNotFoundError is raised when you try to access a file that doesn't exist


# FileExistsError is raised when a file or directory already exists

# NotADirectoryError is raised when try to perform a dir operation on a non-dir object
